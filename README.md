# Project Portfolio Website


## Description

For my week 2 Bootcamp assignment, I built a portfolio website to showcase the knowledge I gained over the past two weeks of classes.

I employed two popular layout techniques, namely `Grid` and `Flexbox`. The process became challenging when dealing with nested grids and grid items, as it's easy to disrupt the layout. However, this challenge provided valuable practical experience, and I learned effective solutions for the encountered issues.

One significant aspect of the project was implementing @media queries to ensure a responsive layout adaptable to various screen sizes.
